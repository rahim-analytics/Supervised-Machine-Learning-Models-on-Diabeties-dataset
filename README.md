# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores various **supervised machine learning** algorithms to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians dataset. Multiple models are trained, tested, and evaluated to determine the most accurate and effective ones.
